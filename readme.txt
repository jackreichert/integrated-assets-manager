Integrated file management tools into WP Media.

== Description ==

This is the complete rebuild V2 of my plugin [Assets Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/assets-manager/). It is a self-hosted file sharing tool. Born out of the need for a file sharing tool that was not blocked by high security firewalls, such as many existing file sharing services are, Assets Manager was developed. When you upload a file, or set of files, Assets Manager generates obscured links to the files so that you can control how those files are shared.

[Hereâ€™s how it works.](http://www.jackreichert.com/2015/11/15/how-assets-manager-replaced-our-sharefile/)

= Features =
* Set an expiration period for when the file link will expire.
* Disable links after they've been shared (no more fretting when sending out emails).
* Force anyone trying to access a link to log into your site.
